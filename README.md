# Total Open Station To QGIS
 It is a qgis luncher for Total Open Station (TOPS for friends) and that is a free software program for downloading and processing data from total station devices. This one is a plugin to connect with totalopenstation software developed as part of the IOSA project by Stefano Costa and Luca Bianconi, archaeologists.
